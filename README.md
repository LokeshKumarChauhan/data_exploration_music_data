# Project : Data Exploration - Music Data
## Overview </br>
The objective of this project was to build an end-to-end big data solution from scratch. The focus was on analyzing a large amount of music data collected from the website and app of a leading music company, last.fm (now Spotify). The aim was to understand user behavior to improve recommendations, target the right set of users for ads, and calculate royalties for artists and music companies. Additionally, the project sought to gain insights into user demographics such as gender, age, and country </br>
### Steps
# Data Collection
The first step in the project was to collect the music data from the last.fm website and app. The data was obtained from various sources and stored in a suitable data storage system.</br>

## Problem Statement
The problem statement for this project was to analyze the collected music data to understand user behavior, demographics, and preferences. The specific objectives included:</br>

Improve music recommendations for users.</br>
Target the right users for advertisements to increase revenue.</br>
Calculate royalties for different artists and music companies.</br>
Analyze user demographics including gender, age, and country.</br>

## Data Exploration </br>
The data exploration phase involved a comprehensive analysis of the collected music data. The primary focus was on understanding user behavior and demographics.</br>

### Gender Analysis </br>
To understand the behavior of male and female users, the data was analyzed based on gender. Key insights were derived regarding the preferences, listening patterns, and engagement levels of male and female users.</br>

### Age Analysis </br>
The age analysis aimed to create age buckets and track the behavior of users in each bucket. By grouping users into different age ranges, valuable insights were obtained about the preferences and engagement levels of users in different age groups.</br>

### Country Analysis </br>
Analyzing the country data helped in expanding the company's reach to other countries. By studying user behavior and preferences across different countries, opportunities for market expansion and localization were identified. </br>

## Code
The code developed for this project involved data processing, analysis, and visualization. Various programming languages and tools were utilized, including Python, Apache Spark, and relevant data processing libraries. </br>

## Business Strategies </br>
Based on the insights gained from the data exploration phase, several business strategies were proposed: </br>

Enhanced Recommendations: Utilize the understanding of user behavior to improve music recommendations for personalized user experiences.</br>

Targeted Advertising: Use user demographics and behavior data to target the right set of users for advertisements, thereby increasing revenue through more effective ad campaigns.</br>

Royalty Calculations: Utilize the analyzed data to calculate royalties for different artists and music companies based on user interactions and engagement.</br>

## Statistical Data Analysis: Unsupervised Learning - K-Means Clustering </br>
In addition to exploring user behavior and demographics, unsupervised learning techniques were employed to cluster similar users and artists. K-means clustering was applied to group users and artists based on shared characteristics and preferences. This analysis helped identify user segments and artist clusters, enabling better understanding and targeted actions. </br>

## Conclusion </br>
The data exploration phase of the music data project provided valuable insights into user behavior, demographics, and preferences. By understanding user behavior, personalized recommendations can be improved, targeted advertising strategies can be implemented, and royalty calculations can be made more accurate. The statistical data analysis using K-means clustering allowed for the identification of user segments and artist clusters, facilitating targeted actions and decision-making.</br>

The insights gained from this project are expected to contribute to the growth and success of the music company, enhancing the overall user experience, revenue generation, and market expansion.</br>
